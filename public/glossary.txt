OPERATORS, KEYWORDS, COMMANDS, FUNCTIONS
========================================

()
    - The empty tuple is a value of () and it also has a type of ().
(.)
    - Function composition operator.
    - Similar to UNIX pipe operator.
(,)
    - Same as (\x y -> (x,y))
(,,)
    - A function that is the same as (\x y z -> (x,y,z))
(:-:)
    - Fixity declaration. Used when defining a function as an operator to give them a fixity.
    - Order of operations.
    - Examples:
        + infixl 7 *        * has fixity of 7 and is left-associative.
        + infixl 6 +        + has fixity of 6 and is left-associative.
(!)
    - Strict field in data constructor
    - Examples:
        + data Trade = Trade { timestamp :: !Word32} deriving (Show)
(->)
    - A functor that ...
(<$>)
    - (<$>) :: (Functor f) => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b 
    - Use normal function on applicative functors
    - Examples:
        + (*) <$> Just 2 <*> Just 8
          Here, <$> applies (*) to 2 inside the applicative functor Just.
(<*>)
    - module: Control.Applicative
    - class (Functor f) => Applicative f where  
        pure :: a -> f a  
        (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b 
    - Extracts function from functor and applies it to other functor
    - Examples:
        + (*) <$> Just 2 <*> Just 8
(>>)
    - implementation:
        (>>) :: (Monad m) => m a -> m b -> m b      
        m >> n = m >>= \_ -> n  
(>>=)
    - (>>=) :: (Monad m) => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b  
    - "bind" function
    - takes a monadic value and a function that takes a normal value, returns
        a monadic value, and applies the function to a monadic value.
class
    - Used to define a new typeclass.
    - Examples:
        class Eq a where                <- Eq is the typeclass being defined
            (==) :: a -> a -> Bool      <- these are functions that can optionally be implemented here
            (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool  
            x == y = not (x /= y)  
            x /= y = not (x == y)
cons
    - synonym for :
data
    - Defines new (data) type with a data constructor.
    - Use the `instance' keyword to make a type an instance of a typeclass.
do
    - Take several I/O actions and glue them into one
instance
    - Makes a type an instance of a typeclass.
Monad
    - A typeclass that...
    - type class:
        class Monad m where  
            return :: a -> m a  
            (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b  
            (>>) :: m a -> m b -> m b  
            x >> y = x >>= \_ -> y  
            fail :: String -> m a  
            fail msg = error msg  
pure
    - wraps normal function up into (an applicative functor?)
    - function that wraps value up into a data type
return
    - Makes an I/O action that doesn't do anything, just yields value as result, doesn't
        do any I/O operations.
    - Wraps the value in an I/O context.
    - Useful when you need I/O output but don't need to actually do anything.
type
    - Type constructor.
    - make new types
    - Examples:
        type Birds = Int            <- type synonym for Int called eBirds'
        type Pole = (Birds,Birds)


========================================
TERMS, CONCEPTS
========================================
action
    - Goes out and brings something back in a box
    - Examples:
        + IO (a -> b)       I/O action that yields a function
        + IO a              I/O action
applicative functor
    - Used to apply functor to functor
    - allow us to view values of certain data types as values with contexts
    - allow us to use normal functions on those values while preserving the meaning of those contexts
    - Examples:
        + 
Applicative typeclass
    - allows us to use normal functions on an applicative value while preserving the context
applicative value
    - value with added context
    - Examples:
        + 'a' is a value. Just 'a' is an applicative value.
class
    - synonym for typeclass
class constraint
    - Specify class of parameter
    - Examples:
        + (Functor f) in:
            (<$>) :: (Functor f) => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b 
concrete type
    - example:
        + Maybe Int
data constructor
    - defines a "data type"
    - examples:
        + data Person = Person { firstName :: String} deriving (Eq)
            * firstName is a "field"
            * Person{...} is a "value constructor". There is one value constructor here.
functor
    - Something that can be mapped over
    - examples:
        + Else
        + Maybe
        + List
    - a computational context
lifting a function
    - taking a function (a -> b) and returning (f a -> f b) where f is a functor.
monad
    - applicative functor that supports the bind (>>=) function.
    - Can be members of classes.
record
    - Examples:
        + data Person = Person String String Int Float String String deriving (Show)  
        + With record syntax: 
              data Person = Person { firstName :: String  
                                   , lastName :: String  
                                   , age :: Int  
                                   , height :: Float  
                                   , phoneNumber :: String  
                                   , flavor :: String  
                                   } deriving (Show)  
type
    - examples:
        + Int
typeclass (or "class")
    - like interfaces of other OO languages
    - A monad can be a member of a class.
    - data type can derive typeclass ('deriving' keyword) and thereby be an "instance"
    - examples:
        + Eq
        + fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b 
        + class (Functor f) => Applicative f where ...
type constructor
    - takes types as parameters and produces new types
    - like a "template" in C++
    - defines a "kind"
    - instance of a type constructor is called "concrete type"
    - examples:
        + (->) r a
        + data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
            a is type parameter
            Since there is a type parameter, Maybe is a type constructor.
type synonym
    - Can be parameterized.
    - Examples:
        + type String = [Char]
value constructor
    - takes value parameter(s) and produces a new value
