OVERVIEW
- parse and print quote messages from data feed
- when invoked with -r flag, re-order messages according to the 'quote accept time' at the exchange.

PARSING
- data feed sent via UDP to ports 15515/15516.
- pcap file supplied to parse UDP packets.
- quote packets
    + begin with ASCII bytes B6034
    + contain five current best bids and offers (or 'asks') on the market.
    + ignore anything else

PRINTING
- print:
    + packet and quote accept time
    + issue code
    + bids from 5th to 1st
    + asks from 1st to 5th

REORDERING
- output messages ordered by qutoe accept time
- quote accept time and pcap packet time never differ more than 3 sec

EFFICIENCY
- large pcap file must be okay too (8GB+); throughput and memory usage.
