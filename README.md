# Demo Details

## Fizz Buzz

### Task:

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

### How to Run

#### Using GHCi

Open the GHCi command line.

Navigate to the fizzbuzz directory using this command, replacing "LocalDirectory" with your local path.

```
:cd C:\LocalDirectory\fizzbuzz\
```

Load the fizzbuzz.hs module using this command:

```
:l fizzbuzz
```

Fizz Buzz using list comprehension:

```
fizzbuzz
```

Fizz Buzz using recursion:

```
fizzbuzz_r
```
