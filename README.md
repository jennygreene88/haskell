# Projects

### Fizz Buzz

##### About this project

Implements various solutions to the Fizz Buzz problem, using various Haskell constructs. Created as a way to use concepts as I learn them. The Fizz Buzz problem is defined like this:

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

##### Instructions

Open the GHCi command line.

Navigate to the fizzbuzz directory using the `cd` command, adjusting the path as necessary:

```
:cd C:\Users\Me\Documents\haskell\fizzbuzz\
```

Load the `fizzbuzz.hs` module:

```
:l fizzbuzz
```

Run Fizz Buzz using list comprehension:

```
fizzbuzz
```

Run Fizz Buzz using recursion:

```
fizzbuzz_r
```

Run Fizz Buzz using a map:

```
fizzbuzz_map
```

Run Fizz Buzz using a high-order function:

```
fizzbuzz_high
```
